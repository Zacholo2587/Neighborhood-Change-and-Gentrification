The Lower East Side has long been known for its immigrant roots, cultural diversity, and workingclass identity. In recent years, rapid gentrification has reshaped the area, replacing affordable housing and small businesses with luxury apartments and high-end retail. This project aims to address these changes by developing fair growth strategies that preserve the community’s culture and affordability while promoting sustainable development.

The focus of this project is to visualize the neighborhood’s transformation. By overlaying maps of the Lower East Side before and after gentrification, we will highlight shifts in housing, demographics, and land use. These visual comparisons will help pinpoint where displacement and redevelopment are most severe. The findings will guide discussions with residents and city planners, ensuring that future policies promote inclusion and balance.

## Method

This is how we created our StoryMap:

We decided to focus on the Lower East Side because of its cultural significance and migrant history, but more importantly the gentrification the area has undergone.

Then, we began looking deeper into the history of the Lower East Side and found pictures and demographic data.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then, we looked deeper into the history of the Lower East Side and found picture and demographic data from the time.

Afterwards, we found how gentrification had affected the area, and began adding the information into our StoryMap through different features on ArcGIS.

- Timeline: Shows the original residents of the Lower East Side, what sparked gentrification, and how gentrification affected the area socailly, economically, and politically.

- Before & After Map: Shows multiple examples of how specific buildings changed as a result of gentrificaiton.

- Policies: Policies put in place to limit the powers of gentrification.

- Average Rent Graph: Shows how much rent for a 1 bedroom apartment has costed from June 2016 to June 2025.

- Gentrification and Displacement Map: Shows block by block the areas of the Lower East Side that are currently going through gentrification, at risk of gentrification, exclusion, and displacement.

- Demographics Graph: Shows the racial diversity of the Lower East Side as of 2025.

- Residents' Perspectives Video: Shows what people living in the Lower East Side think of the changes happening in their neighborhood.

- Household Income Graph: The average value is more than double the median income, which shows how much rich people's incomes skew the average income, compared to what the 50th percentile household makes.

## Final Results

The gentrification of the Lower East Side reveals how deeply urban change can shape the lives, identities, and opportunities of long-standing communities. While new development has brought investment and modernization, it has also increased housing costs, displaced residents, and altered the cultural character that once defined the neighborhood. By examining maps, data, and historical context, this StoryMap shows that the transformation of the Lower East Side is not just a physical one it is social, economic, and emotional. Understanding these changes helps us recognize the importance of protecting community voices, preserving cultural heritage, and promoting more equitable development in New York City moving forward.
