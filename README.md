The Lower East Side has long been known for its immigrant roots, cultural diversity, and workingclass identity. In recent years, rapid gentrification has reshaped the area, replacing affordable housing and small businesses with luxury apartments and high-end retail. This project aims to address these changes by developing fair growth strategies that preserve the community’s culture and affordability while promoting sustainable development.

The focus of this project is to visualize the neighborhood’s transformation. By overlaying maps of the Lower East Side before and after gentrification, we will highlight shifts in housing, demographics, and land use. These visual comparisons will help pinpoint where displacement and redevelopment are most severe. The findings will guide discussions with residents and city planners, ensuring that future policies promote inclusion and balance.
